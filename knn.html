        <p> In our random forest regression model and the reason we chose to do a regression model instread of a classification is because it worked alot better with our dataset. They also excel in capturing non-linear relationships and intricate feature interactions in data, making them suitable for scenarios where relationships are complex. Their robustness to outliers and ability to handle missing values contribute to their reliability. The ensemble nature of Random Forests reduces overfitting, enhancing generalization to new data.</p>
        <p> Utilizing the KNN model simplifies the analysis of voting patterns across counties, offering a straightforward approach compared to more complex models. KNN's simplicity allows for transparent insights into how similar counties tend to vote similarly. This model is suitable when prioritizing simplicity and interpretability, especially in situations where intricate feature interactions are not the main focus.</p>
