    <p> Some backround on our data </p>
    <p>The 2000 U.S. presidential election had a lot of problems, especially in Florida. The votes were super close, so they had to count them again. But there were issues with confusing ballots and messed-up votes called "hanging chads." While they were figuring this out, the Supreme Court stepped in and said, "Stop!" in a close 5-4 decision called Bush v. Gore. This decision gave Florida's votes to George W. Bush, and he became the president.</p>
    <p> People got upset because even though Al Gore got more votes across the country, he didn't win the election. This made folks talk a lot about how the voting system works, like the Electoral College, and if the Supreme Court should decide elections. The 2000 election had a big impact on how we talk about elections and led to some changes in how we vote.
    The outcome raised questions about the electoral process's fairness, especially as Al Gore had won the national popular vote. Debates over the Electoral College system and concerns about the role of the Supreme Court in determining election results gained prominence. The 2000 election's impact lingered, shaping discussions on election procedures and influencing subsequent electoral reforms.</p>
    <p> This is very important for our data analysis because since this was such a contraversial election state. I think that our data analysis will show that we can see who would win per each county and also give us a clear understanding of voting patterns in the 2000 presidential election.</p>
