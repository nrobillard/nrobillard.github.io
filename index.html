        <p>The 2000 U.S. presidential election was marred by controversy, particularly in Florida. The state's razor-thin margin triggered an automatic recount, unveiling issues like confusing "butterfly ballots" and "hanging chads" (incompletely punched holes in ballots). As legal battles ensued, the Supreme Court intervened in Bush v. Gore, delivering a 5-4 decision to stop the recount. This controversial ruling awarded Florida's electoral votes to George W. Bush, deciding the presidency.</p>

    <p>The outcome raised questions about the electoral process's fairness, especially as Al Gore had won the national popular vote. Debates over the Electoral College system and concerns about the role of the Supreme Court in determining election results gained prominence. The 2000 election's impact lingered, shaping discussions on election procedures and influencing subsequent electoral reforms.</p>
